# Stress-Matrix
Operations such as finding principal stresses, stress on plane , transformation of axes can be done using the StressMatrix.m file. Using the code is rather simple, the StressMatrix.xlsx file must contain values on which the operations must be performed. Enter values for the data that is essential.<br>
For example : If you wish to find the stress on a certain plane then enter the direction cosines of the plane and no other data must be enter other than the stress tensor.<br>
A solution excel file will be generated by the code, every time it runs. This file will contain all essential values, including principal stresses and invariants of stresses.<br>
NOTE : The previous solution file is replaced by the newer one
